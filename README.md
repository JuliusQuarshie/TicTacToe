TicTacToe Game

A command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++. Two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 board with 'x' and 'o'. The game detects wins (three in a row, column, or diagonal) and draws when the board fills up.

Features:
* Two-player gameplay with name input validation
* Real-time board display
* Win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
* Draw detection when board is full
* Input validation and replay prevention for occupied spaces

How to Play:
1. Compile: g++ [game.cpp](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) -o game
2. Run: game.exe
3. Enter both player names (must be different)
4. Players alternate entering numbers 1-9 to mark their position on the board
5. First player to get three in a row wins!
